For example, <code>True Ocean</code> means the mission outcome was successfully landed to a specific region of the ocean while <code>False Ocean</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a specific region of the ocean. <code>True RTLS</code> means the mission outcome was successfully  landed to a ground pad <code>False RTLS</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a ground pad.<code>True ASDS</code> means the mission outcome was successfully landed on  a drone ship <code>False ASDS</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed on a drone ship.\n",
